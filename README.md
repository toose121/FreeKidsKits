FreeKidsKits
============

Website that collects end user information - Lead source

First off, this is my first project while using GitHub. Im using Visual Studio to create and manage my projects, which should explain why there are so many folders involved in this repository. If you would like to suggest a better way to manage/organize, please email me at cditusa@gmail.com.

Anyway - most all the files needed to compile this project reside in the Root directory. CustDAL is just the Data Access Layer for a (currently) single table database. I figured if I wanted to include this within the FreeKidsKits project, that i should nest the program directories.
